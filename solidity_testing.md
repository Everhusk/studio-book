# Solidity Testing

### or Learn to love N.D.T. (Non Destructive Testing)



Since D-day Ive been gathering up links to formal solidity testing frameworks/projects. These projects aim to add a layer of semantic reasoning and verification to writing smart contracts. 
These are in progress beta in development.

[https://github.com/ether-camp/ethereum-testing-reference](https://github.com/ether-camp/ethereum-testing-reference) <--A self contained simple Ethereum testing system for Solidity smart contracts. 

[https://docs.erisindustries.com/tutorials/solidity/solidity-4/](https://docs.erisindustries.com/tutorials/solidity/solidity-4/)   <--nice tiered testing strategies.

[https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph](https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph) <---I like this: it's graphical ..plays nice with Studio IDE ..Generates a DOT graph that "visualizes function control flow of a Solidity contract and highlights potential security vulnerabilities". According to the dev, it doesn't yet handle large sol files.
