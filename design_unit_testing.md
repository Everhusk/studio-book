# Design unit testing

Studio uses Mocha by default. Of course, you are free to use whatever unit testing framework you want. You can also use ether.camp's new  [Ethereum Testing Reference](https://github.com/ether-camp/ethereum-testing-reference)  that runs unit tests you write yourself.  It is a standalone framework that is very fast and more akin to full stack javascript development with Node.js
