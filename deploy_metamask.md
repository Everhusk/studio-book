# Deploy to Metamask

[Metamask](https://metamask.io) is a Chrome web browser extension that allows user to visit webpages that interact with the ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access blockchain contracts without having to set up and run a full ethereum node. Metamask uses a consortium node run by the famous Consensys group.

In principle, using the Ethereum Studio IDE one can deploy Dapps compatible with a Metamask enabled browser. It is beyond the scope of this document on how to prepare your web3 enabled Dapps to run in Metamask. However you can consult the metamask document: [MetaMask Compatibility Guide for Developers.](https://github.com/MetaMask/faq/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md)
