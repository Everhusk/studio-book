# Solidity primer

Writing smart contracts is a subset of full Dapp deployment. One can write a contract and let users interact and use that contract via a Ethereum node client (eg. Mist). You can **use [live.ether.camp/contracts](https://live.ether.camp/contracts) online to watch ethereum blockchain Tx (transactions), addresses and invoke contracts**. But the full potential of Dapps enables  UX (user experience) and more functionalities. For example see https://www.augur.net/ and http://oraclize.it/

But before diving into Dapp development it is important to get a good grasp of smart contract writing. Solidity is a fully typed language (based on javascript and C##) to develop and compile smart contract code.

Read [Solidity tutorials](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html), do a simple "Hello World" greeter and compile your Solidity code in your [sandbox](https://nogo10.gitbooks.io/ether-camp-live-studio-primer/content/sandbox_features.html). See tutorials: * [http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Also, Eris Industries tutorials show some useful strategies for structuring complex contracts:
