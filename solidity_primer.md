# Solidity primer

Before diving into Dapp development it is important to get a good grasp of smart contract writing. Solidity is a fully typed language (based on javascript and C##) to develop and compile smart contract code.

You can start by having a look at https://live.ether.camp/ and see all the deployed contracts on the ethereum blockchain. Their source code are often accessible to read and can be 'called' from your own deployed contracts (more on that later).

Read [Solidity tutorials](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html), do a simple "Hello World" greeter and compile your Solidity code in your [sandbox](https://nogo10.gitbooks.io/ether-camp-live-studio-primer/content/sandbox_features.html).

Writing smart contracts is a subset of full Dapp deployment. One can write a contract and let users interact and use that contract via a Ethereum node client (eg. Mist). You can **use [live.ether.camp/contracts](https://live.ether.camp/contracts) online to watch ethereum blockchain Tx (transactions), addresses and invoke contracts**. But the full potential of Dapps enables  UX (user experience) and more functionalities. For example see https://www.augur.net/ and http://oraclize.it/
