# Solidity primer

Solidity is a fully typed language (based on javascript and C##) to develop and compile smart contract code.

You can start by having a look at https://live.ether.camp/ and see all the deployed contracts on the ethereum blockchain. Their source code are often accessible to read and can be 'called' from your own deployed contracts (more on that later).

Read through [Solidity tutorials](https://ethereumbuilders.gitbooks.io/guide/content/en/solidity_tutorials.html), and do [a simple "Hello World"](https://ethereum.org/greeter) example and even compile your Solidity code [in your browser](http://chriseth.github.io/cpp-ethereum).
