# Example projects


Out of the box, Studio has a very basic example project which can be copied to a new project folder and edited to get going on your project.

Alternatively,  you can study the Wallet app example which is more suitable for production.  In the terminal type: 

```git clone https://github.com/ether-camp/wallet.git``` 
  
Which loads a copy of the Wallet.app into the workspace directory.
