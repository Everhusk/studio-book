# ƒêapp-e-chitecture


Dapp structure is a node.js express framework with a web3.js module to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.  


Once you run your contract[5], a API json is created in the sandbox[2] allowing javascript app.js[4] to read/write [1] access to the contract on the blockchain[2].
