# ƒêapp-e-chitecture


Dapp structure is a node.js express framework with a web3.js module to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. The front-end can be vanilla html/css/js or any MVC framework of your choice. Data storage on the Ethereum blockchain is still too expensive to use the blockchain as a full backend. Decentralized storage implementations do exist (IPFS and Swarm). However it is beyond the scope of this documentation. IPFS may be featured in the Advanced section at a later date. 


Once you run your contract[5], a API json is created in the sandbox[2] allowing javascript app.js[4] to read/write [1] access to the contract on the blockchain[2].
